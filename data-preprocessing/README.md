In this folder, you can find examples of pre-processing pipelines for experiments interested in pupil size and/or eye movements (03/10/2024: This is still under construction).

In the meantime, here are some tutorials and examples of code.

# Eye movements

Something to bear in mind is that certain paradigms are easier to pre-processing in open source software (e.g., reading v VWP).

## Python


# Pupillometry

(https://sites.google.com/view/drewjmclaughlin/pupillometry)[Drew McLaughlin] organised a workshop at BCBL. In this folder you can find both the theory slides but also examples of code and the recordings of the tutorial.

(https://www.ling.uni-konstanz.de/forschung/workshops/)[Lauren Fink] run a two-days workshop at Konstanz Linguistics. In this page, you can access the recordings and her materials.
